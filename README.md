## JTRAVEL TOUR

### Overview

A demonstration website for a travel agency which features Japan. Designed and developed by myself.

### keyword

HTML, Sass, JavaScript, Swiper.js, Figma

### Design and Development

I created this website to brush up my front end skills using HTML, Sass and JavaScript, and also learn a flow from designing to developing. Design involves creating sketching, user flow, sitemaps,wireframes and mockup.

For development, I used Sass to break down style files to smaller components considering readability and maintainability. For the motion of card flow, I used 'cover flow' by swiper.js. For testimonials and FAQ, they are created by pure JavaScript.
